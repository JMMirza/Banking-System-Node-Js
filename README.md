Hey there! This is my first Node js application and below I have provided minimum information about it. Please go through it.

This application contains 5 functionalities, 
1. Register user: this function is simple as it is name, we just have to send data from the body and if the data is proper and contains all fields that are required then it will inserted into the mongodb.
2. Login: the user is authenticate by the email address and password then after login the token is generated and send to the user in the header.
3. Add funds: if a user wants to add fund in his account first he has to provide the token to authorize himself and the send amount in the body of the request.
4. Transfer funds: same as the user wants to transfer funds from one account to another, first authorize himself and give the email of receiver and amount to transfer so the transfer is done if two conditions are fulfilled that receiver should exits and amount must be smaller than the send bank balance
5. Forget password: after authorization the password you have send in the body of the request will updated.
